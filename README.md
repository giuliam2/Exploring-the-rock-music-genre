    <h1>The History of the Guitar</h1>
  </div>

  <h2><em>A story written by Sofia Mangione and Simona Serramondi</em></h2>
  <p class="small-italic">Hello guys! With this little overview you will have the opportunity to discover the history behind the stringed instruments we play on a daily basis, with a particular attention to the instrument who changed the whole world of music: the guitar. Let yourself be carried away by the inebriating sounds of this instrument and begin this journey of music with us!</p>


  <div class="article">
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>The sounds that music offers us are varied: they range from a slight emission of breath to a more or less loud beat. Yet, in the common imagination what most refers to the idea of music is a touch of strings that in its multiple forms gives birth to many different genres of music. It is precisely from that graceful touch that for many people the principle of music, its essence, begins. However, what produces those melodious guitar sounds? Thanks to the table presented on Melody, you can see yourselves how the individual components of the guitar come together to create a magic of sounds.
For those who are more passionate and interested in approaching this world, we offer you the possibility of finding out for yourselves what kind of material the models you are most interested in are made of.
The guitar over the years has become increasingly influential, even to the point of having a major impact on world markets. Here, then, the charts show which guitars have been most sold over a period of time from the 1990s, the prominent years of rock music, to our days. </p>

  <div class="white-box">
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;" >Have you ever wondered, however, what made people buy this instrument more and more? We did. Throughout the history of music, audiences have been influenced by influential guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan, whose energy and passion were able to engage and attract their audiences. So, people, whether for amateur or professional use, began to purchase this instrument.
American influence did not take long to spread around the world, and so today even countries far away enjoy the footsteps left by those who really knew how to appreciate this instrument. In the map provided on Melody, you are shown the countries with their own number of guitarists.
Through this project you will be able to see how the guitar from a simple wooden object becomes everyday music for our ears capable of reaching the whole world with its sound.
