Picture this: the 1950s, a time when rock music burst onto the scene and quickly took the world by storm. Soon enough it became the unrivaled king of popular music, leaving a lasting impact that would shape the future of the industry. From Led Zeppelin’s electrifying performances to Jimi Hendrix’s infectious guitar riffs, rock music was an unstoppable force of creativity and rebellion. <br>
But let's zoom in on the USA, the birthplace of many influential rock bands. One name that instantly comes to mind is Nirvana, undoubtedly one of the most famous bands in the history of the USA. Led by the legendary Kurt Cobain, this band became a symbol of the rock music genre. Cobain, not content with just being a mesmerizing vocalist, also wielded his guitar with finesse. And he wasn't alone. Many members of Nirvana, as well as other rock bands, showcased their incredible versatility by playing multiple roles. But who else is connected to Cobain and plays guitar, besides singing? His wife Courtney Love, singer and guitarist of American rock band Hole. What’s interesting about this band? Well, the first thing that immediately catches one's attention is undoubtedly the fact that Hole is an all-female band, something unusual in the landscape of the rock genre. Numbers speak for themselves: out of 16 bands, only one is entirely made up of women!
